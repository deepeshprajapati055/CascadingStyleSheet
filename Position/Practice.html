Any implementation that conforms to the JVM specification should be able to run code compiled into Java bytecode irrespective of the language in which the code was originally written. In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the .java extension. Those source files are then compiled into .class files by the javac compiler. A .class file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecode — the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine.
